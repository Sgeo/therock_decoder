# therock_decoder

## Usage

* Put in a directory with ffmpeg and SCIGUY.MOV from the Stop the Rock CD
* Run the program.

The directory will fill with .mov files.

Note that there seem to be some empty ones. These may represent a defect in my approach.

Also note that SCIGUY.MOV will be written to and rendered unusable by the game.
